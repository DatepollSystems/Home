Translations in DatePoll are machine translated using [LibreTranslate (translate.dafnik.me)](https://translate.dafnik.me)
into the following languages:
1. English
1. Spanish
1. Portuguese
1. French
1. Italian

However it is possible to overwrite auto generated translations.

:::warning Please read
**Everything written below is only neceassary if you want to create a production build or to work on translations.**

## Translating strings for the frontend
Manual written language files are stored under `src/assets/i18n/` in `de.json`, `en.json`, etc.

:::note Good to know
`de.json` is the **standard language** file and contains all translation strings. Nothing is autogenerated for `de.json`.
:::

After translating your strings run the following command to apply all changes to the autogenerated language files.
:::warning
**On the first time, translations can take up to 30 minutes.**

Please consider that the translation server hasn't unlimited resources. If it's getting abused it's going to be 
**rate limited**. Translated strings are **cached** to minimize server usage. **Don't delete** the cache files 
located in `translation/`.

```
chmod +x ./languages.sh && ./languages.sh
```

Lastly commit your changes and make a pull request.
